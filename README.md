# Thoth::Tarot

Welcome to Thoth Tarot Ruby Gem! 

This is a Gem created to consult Thoth Tarot card readings using the CLI.

In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/thoth/tarot`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thoth-tarot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thoth-tarot

## Usage

First select from the menu list.

Major Arcana 
Wands
Cups
Swords
Disks

Then select the card you wish to know more about.           

After gathering the info from the user it will display all content for the card.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
