# Thoth::Tarot

Welcome to Thoth Tarot Ruby Gem! 

![](Thoth.png)

This is a Gem created to consult Thoth Tarot card readings using the CLI.

In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/thoth_tarot`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thoth-tarot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thoth-tarot

## Usage

Run bin/thoth

It will welcome you and ask for input to view card listing.

Select the number of the card you wish to know more about.

Card profile is shown.

You can choose another card or exit.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 

The run `rake spec` is not set at the moment. No tests are yet developed for this gem.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
